	 <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm. It helps us understand how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. Efficient algorithms are designed to have low time complexity, making them faster and more scalable.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. It's an essential factor when considering an algorithm's performance, especially in environments with limited memory. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) will require additional memory proportional to the input size.
