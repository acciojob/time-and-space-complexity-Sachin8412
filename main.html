	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, making them faster and more scalable.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), to describe the worst-case scenario.</p>
